### Introduction

This is one homework of the lesson Neural Network and Deep Learning, which requires us to write two networks to recognize the handwritten digits.
The accuracy of my mlp network is 90% and the one of my cnn network is 82%.

### Train the model.

Open test_train_{model}.py, modify parameters and run it.
If you want to train the model on your own dataset, just change the values of variable *train_images_path* and *train_labels_path*

### Test the model.

Open test_model_{model}.py, specify the saved model's path and the test dataset's path, then run the script, the script will output the accuracy on the test dataset.

### Save the model.

All of the saved models are in the file "saved_models".The final chosen models are in the file "final_models".
